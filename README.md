## Home Page

There has 6/Six box of  
### User List, Friend List, Friend Request, Group Create & List, My Group, Unblock.

On this social platform, users have the ability to send friend requests, create their own groups, join existing groups, and also have the option to block friends etc.

## Message Page
Here is a small problem, without any friend ther have no access to browse that page. If you have minimum one friend or any group then you can browse message page. 

### I will fix this problem very quickly. 

## Notification Page
Notifications are displayed when someone sends you a friend request
## Setting Page
#### Coming Soon
